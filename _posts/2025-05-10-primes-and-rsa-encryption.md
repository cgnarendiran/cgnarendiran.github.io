*On the cover: RSA Encryption*

If you‚Äôve ever shopped online, sent a private message, or connected to a secure website, you‚Äôve probably used RSA encryption without even knowing it. RSA is one of the most famous cryptographic systems, and what makes it magical is this:

> You can tell the whole world how to lock a message for you

> But only you can unlock it.

This blog is a beginner-friendly walk-through of **how** that‚Äôs possible, why we don‚Äôt just share our secret key, and why a couple of prime numbers hold the entire system together.

## The Padlock Story (Simon Singh‚Äôs analogy)

Imagine you want to send me a secret message by mail.

1. I send you an **open padlock** ‚Äî but **keep the key** with me.
2. You put your message in a box, lock it with my padlock, and send it back.
3. Because the box is locked, **only I** (who has the key) can open it.

The magic is:

* You never got my private key.
* Anyone can lock a box for me, but no one else can open it.

RSA works on the **same idea**, except the padlock is just a **big number** called **n**, and the way to lock something is using a public number **e**.

## The Ingredients

1. **Two large prime numbers**: $p$ and $q$ of the order of 100s of digits
   (We keep these secret.)
2. **Their product**: $n = p \times q$
   (This is the ‚Äúpadlock‚Äù ‚Äî we give this to everyone.)
3. **Totient**: $\varphi(n) = (p-1) \times (q-1)$
   (This is used for building the key.)
4. **Public exponent**: $e$

   * A small number that‚Äôs coprime to $\varphi(n)$ ‚Äî often 3, 17, or 65537.
   * This is the ‚Äúhow to lock the box‚Äù number.
   * We give out **both $n$ and $e$** to the world.
     This is totally safe ‚Äî knowing $n$ and $e$ doesn‚Äôt help anyone find $p$ and $q$ if they‚Äôre large enough.


## Why We Give Out e (and n)

If we didn‚Äôt give $e$, people wouldn‚Äôt know *how* to lock messages for us.

Think of $n$ as the shape of the padlock, and $e$ as the turning method.
Both are needed to lock something, but **only the person with $d$** (the private key) can reverse it.

Mathematically:

* Public key = $(e, n)$
* Private key = $(d, n)$
* $d$ is computed from $e$ and $\varphi(n)$ using the modular inverse:

  $$
  e \times d \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ \varphi(n))
  $$

> NOTE: The  $c = a \ (\text{mod} \ b)$ just means that the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$ is $c$.
> NOTE: This  $a \equiv b \ (\text{mod} \ n)$ just means that $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by $n$.

## The Core Encryption and Decryption

1. **Encryption** (locking the box):

   $$
   C \equiv M^e \ (\text{mod} \ n)
   $$

   Where:

   * $M$ is your message (as a number),
   * $C$ is the encrypted message.

2. **Decryption** (unlocking the box):

   $$
   M \equiv C^d \ (\text{mod} \ n)
   $$

   So you get back your message at your end!


## Mathematical Intuition

All this is good, but why does this work? All because of a nice **Euler‚Äôs theorem**, and the way we pick the $e$ and $d$. To be more concrete, let's go over what we do step by step:

* pick two primes $p, q$, set $n = pq$.
* compute $\varphi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$.
* choose $e$ such that $\gcd(e,\varphi(n))=1$.
* choose $d$ as the **modular inverse** of $e$ modulo $\varphi(n)$:

  $$
  ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\varphi(n)} \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad ed = 1 + k\,\varphi(n)\ \text{for some integer }k.
  $$

Encryption is $C \equiv M^e \pmod n$.
Decryption claims $M \equiv C^d \pmod n$.

**Why is that true?**

Consider the product exponent $ed$:

$$
M^{ed} \;=\; M^{1+k\varphi(n)} \;=\; M \cdot \big(M^{\varphi(n)}\big)^k.
$$

**Euler‚Äôs theorem** says: if $\gcd(M,n)=1$, then

$$
M^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n.
$$

Plug that in:

$$
M^{ed} \equiv M \cdot 1^k \equiv M \pmod n.
$$

But $C \equiv M^e \pmod n$, so

$$
C^d \equiv (M^e)^d \equiv M^{ed} \equiv M \pmod n.
$$

That‚Äôs the whole trick: picking $d$ so that $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\varphi(n)}$ makes exponentiation ‚Äúundo‚Äù itself.


### what if $M$ shares a factor with $n$? (edge cases)

If $M$ is divisible by $p$ or $q$, the above ‚Äú$\gcd(M,n)=1$‚Äù assumption breaks. RSA still works, and the clean way to see it is to check the congruence **mod $p$** and **mod $q$** separately and then combine them (Chinese Remainder Theorem):

* **Case mod $p$:**
  If $p \mid M$, then $M \equiv 0 \pmod p$, so trivially $M^{ed} \equiv 0 \equiv M \pmod p$.
  If $p \nmid M$, use **Fermat‚Äôs little theorem**: $M^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p$.
  Because $ed = 1 + k(p-1)(q-1)$, $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{p-1}$, so $M^{ed} \equiv M \pmod p$.

* **Same mod $q$.**
  Put the two congruences together ‚Üí $M^{ed} \equiv M \pmod n$.

So the decryption step is valid for **all** $M \in \{0,\dots,n-1\}$.



## **A Small Example (for us measely humans)**

Let‚Äôs pick tiny numbers (not secure at all):

* $p = 5$, $q = 11$
* $n = 55$
* $\varphi(n) = (5-1) \times (11-1) = 4 \times 10 = 40$
* Pick $e = 3$ (coprime to 40)
* Find $d$ such that $3d \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ 40)$ ‚Üí $d = 27$

Public key: $(e=3, n=55)$
Private key: $(d=27, n=55)$

Say we want to encrypt $M = 12$:

* **Encrypt**: $C = 12^3 \ \text{mod} \ 55 = 1728 \ \text{mod} \ 55 = 23$
* **Decrypt**: $M = 23^{27} \ \text{mod} \ 55 = 12$ ‚úÖ

## **Why it‚Äôs secure**

If someone knows $n$ and $e$:

* They can encrypt messages to you.
* But they can‚Äôt easily find $d$ without knowing $\varphi(n)$.
* And to get $\varphi(n)$, they must factor $n$ into $p$ and $q$.
* With large enough primes (hundreds of digits long), factoring is practically impossible with today‚Äôs computers.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

RSA is a beautiful mix of:

* Simple number theory,
* Clever key sharing,
* And hard computational problems.

Simon Singh‚Äôs padlock analogy nails the intuition, but the real magic is in how $e$ and $d$ are linked by $\varphi(n)$, while $n$ acts as the public padlock.

Next time you see ‚Äúüîí‚Äù in your browser, remember: somewhere, giant primes are keeping your secrets safe.

Fin.
