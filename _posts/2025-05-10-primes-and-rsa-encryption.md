*On the cover: RSA Encryption*

If you‚Äôve ever shopped online, sent a private message, or connected to a secure website, you‚Äôve probably used RSA encryption without even knowing it. RSA was founded by three mathematicians Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman (RSA) from MIT after whom it's named. RSA is one of the most famous cryptographic systems, and what makes it magical is this:

> You can tell the whole world how to lock a message for you, but only you can unlock it.

This blog is a beginner-friendly walk-through of **how** that‚Äôs possible, and why a couple of large prime numbers hold the entire system together.

## The Padlock Story (Simon Singh‚Äôs analogy)

Imagine you want to send me a secret message by mail.

1. I send you an **open padlock** ‚Äî but **keep the key** with me.
2. You put your message in a box, lock it with my padlock, and send it back.
3. Because the box is locked, **only I** (who has the key) can open it.

The magic is:

* You never got my private key.
* Anyone can lock a box for me, but no one else can open it.

RSA works on the **same idea**, except the padlock is just a **big number** called **n**, and the way to lock something is using a public number **e**. In the context of Computers, the padlock is called a **public key** and the secure key is called a **private key**. Also, this analogy is taken from the book [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://simonsingh.net/books/fermats-last-theorem/the-whole-story) by **Simon Singh**. Definitely recommend!


## The Ingredients

1. **Two large prime numbers**: $p$ and $q$ of the order of 100s of digits
   (We keep these secret.)
2. **Their product**: $n = p \times q$
   (This is the ‚Äúpadlock‚Äù ‚Äî we give this to everyone.)
3. **Euler's Totient**: $\varphi(n) = (p-1) \times (q-1)$
   (This is used for building the key.)
4. **Public exponent**: $e$

   * A small number that‚Äôs coprime to $\varphi(n)$ ‚Äî often 3, 17, or 65537.
   * This is the ‚Äúhow to lock the box‚Äù number.
   * We give out **both $n$ and $e$** to the world.
     This is totally safe ‚Äî knowing $n$ and $e$ doesn‚Äôt help anyone find $p$ and $q$ if they‚Äôre large enough.


## Why We Give Out e (and n)

If we didn‚Äôt give $e$, people wouldn‚Äôt know *how* to lock messages for us.

Think of $n$ as the shape of the padlock, and $e$ as the turning method.
Both are needed to lock something, but **only the person with $d$** (the private key) can reverse it.

Mathematically:

* Public key = $(e, n)$
* Private key = $(d, n)$
* $d$ is computed from $e$ and $\varphi(n)$ using the modular inverse:

  $$
  e \times d \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ \varphi(n))
  $$

* **NOTE**: The  $c = a \ (\text{mod} \ b)$ just means that the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$ is $c$.

* **NOTE**: This  $a \equiv b \ (\text{mod} \ n)$ just means that $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by $n$.

* **NOTE**: The $\gcd(a,b)$ just means the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$.


## The Core Encryption and Decryption

1. **Encryption** (locking the box):

   $$
   C \equiv M^e \ (\text{mod} \ n)
   $$

   Where:

   * $M$ is your message (as a number),
   * $C$ is the encrypted message.

2. **Decryption** (unlocking the box):

   $$
   M \equiv C^d \ (\text{mod} \ n)
   $$

   So you get back your message at your end!


## Mathematical Intuition

All this is good, but why does this work? All because of a nice **Euler‚Äôs theorem**, and the way we pick the $e$ and $d$. To be more concrete, let's go over what we do step by step:

* Pick two primes $p, q$ and set $n = pq$.
* Compute the Euler's totient, $\varphi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$.
* Choose $e$ such that $\gcd(e,\varphi(n))=1$, i.e. $e$ and $\varphi(n)$ are coprime.
* Choose $d$ as the **modular inverse** of $e$ modulo $\varphi(n)$, i.e. $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\varphi(n)} \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad ed = 1 + k\,\varphi(n)\ \text{for some integer }k.$

Encryption is $C \equiv M^e \pmod n$.

Decryption claims $M \equiv C^d \pmod n$.

**Why is that true?**

Consider the product exponent $ed$:

$$
M^{ed} \;=\; M^{1+k\varphi(n)} \;=\; M \cdot \big(M^{\varphi(n)}\big)^k.
$$

**Euler‚Äôs theorem** says: if $\gcd(M,n)=1$, then

$$
M^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n.
$$

Plug that in:

$$
M^{ed} \equiv M \cdot \big(M^{\varphi(n)}\big)^k \equiv M \cdot 1^k \equiv M \pmod n.
$$

But $C \equiv M^e \pmod n$, so

$$
C^d \equiv (M^e)^d \equiv M^{ed} \equiv M \pmod n.
$$

That‚Äôs the whole trick: picking $d$ so that $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\varphi(n)}$ makes exponentiation ‚Äúundo‚Äù itself.


### what if $M$ shares a factor with $n$? (edge cases)

If $M$ is divisible by $p$ or $q$, the above Euler's theorm ‚Äú$\gcd(M,n)=1$‚Äù assumption breaks. But RSA still works! The clean way to see it is to check the congruence **mod $p$** and **mod $q$** separately and then combine them (Chinese Remainder Theorem):

If $p \mid M$, then $M \equiv 0 \pmod p$, so trivially $M^{ed} \equiv 0 \equiv M \pmod p$.

If $p \nmid M$, we can use **Fermat‚Äôs little theorem**: $M^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p$.

$$
M^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p.
$$

Now raise $M$ to the power $ed$:

$$
M^{ed} = M^{1 + m(p-1)}.
$$

Split it:

$$
M^{ed} = M \cdot \big(M^{p-1}\big)^m.
$$


Since $M^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p$:

$$
\big(M^{p-1}\big)^m \equiv 1^m \equiv 1 \pmod p.
$$

So:

$$
M^{ed} \equiv M \cdot 1 \equiv M \pmod p.
$$

Because $ed = 1 + k(p-1)(q-1)$, $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{p-1}$, so $M^{ed} \equiv M \pmod p$.

Put the two congruences for $p$ and $q$ together ‚Üí $M^{ed} \equiv M \pmod n$.

So the decryption step is valid for **all** $M \in \{0,\dots,n-1\}$.


## **A Small Example (for us measely humans)**

Let‚Äôs pick tiny numbers (not secure at all):

* $p = 5$, $q = 11$
* $n = 55$
* $\varphi(n) = (5-1) \times (11-1) = 4 \times 10 = 40$
* Pick $e = 3$ (coprime to 40)
* Find $d$ such that $3d \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ 40)$ ‚Üí $d = 27$

Public key: $(e=3, n=55)$
Private key: $(d=27, n=55)$

Say we want to encrypt $M = 12$:

* **Encrypt**: $C = 12^3 \ \text{mod} \ 55 = 1728 \ \text{mod} \ 55 = 23$

* **Decrypt**: $M = 23^{27} \ \text{mod} \ 55 = 12$


## **Why is it secure?**

If someone knows $n$ and $e$:

* They can encrypt messages to you.
* But they can‚Äôt easily find $d$ without knowing $\varphi(n)$.
* And to get $\varphi(n)$, they must factor $n$ into $p$ and $q$.
* With large enough primes (hundreds of digits long), factoring is practically impossible with today‚Äôs computers.

RSA is a beautiful mix of:

* Simple number theory,
* Clever key sharing,
* And hard computational problems.

Simon Singh‚Äôs padlock analogy nails the intuition, but the real magic is in how $e$ and $d$ are linked by $\varphi(n)$, while $n$ acts as the public padlock.

## From RSA Theory to Practice: `ssh-keygen`

So far, we‚Äôve seen the math behind RSA ‚Äî two primes, $n=pq$, Euler‚Äôs totient $\varphi(n)$, the exponents $e$ and $d$. But how does this translate into something real, like the SSH keys we use every day?

The command you‚Äôve probably typed before is:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

Let‚Äôs break it down:


### 1. Where do you create the keys?

You should **always generate the key pair on your own computer (your client machine)**, not on the server.

**Reason:** Your private key is like your house key. You don‚Äôt want to hand it to anyone else (including the server). You create it locally and keep it safe.

After you run `ssh-keygen`, you‚Äôll usually get two files:

* `~/.ssh/id_rsa` ‚Üí **Private key** (keep this secret, never copy it anywhere).
* `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` ‚Üí **Public key** (safe to share).


### 2. Where do the keys go?

* **Private Key (your secret):**
  Stays **only on your personal computer** (in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

  * Never upload it to the server.
  * Never email it.
  * Never share it.

* **Public Key (shareable):**
  This goes to the **server you want to connect to**. Specifically, it should be added to the file:

  ```
  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

  on the server (inside your user account).

You can copy it using:

```bash
ssh-copy-id user@server
```

or manually appending the contents of `id_rsa.pub` to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server.


### 3. What happens when you log in?

When you run:

```bash
ssh user@server
```

1. The server checks your `authorized_keys` file for your public key.
2. It encrypts a challenge using that key.
3. Your client uses your **private key** to prove you can decrypt the challenge.
4. If it matches, you‚Äôre in ‚Äî no password needed.


### 4. Why this design?

* You can copy the **same public key** to multiple servers.
* You keep **one private key** on your laptop.
* This way, you carry your ‚Äúidentity‚Äù with you, instead of managing passwords on every server.


### Common Mistakes

* **Generating keys on the server:**
  If you do this, your private key lives on the server. That defeats the purpose, because you won‚Äôt be able to log in from your laptop later.

* **Copying the private key to the server:**
  Never do this! Only the **public key** belongs on the server.


So in short:

* **Create keys on your computer.**
* **Keep the private key local.**
* **Copy only the public key to the server.**

That‚Äôs how RSA moves from math (primes, exponents) into a real-world workflow you use every day when typing `ssh`.

Next time you see ‚Äúüîí‚Äù in your browser or you're typing `ssh` to login, remember: somewhere, giant primes are keeping your secrets safe.

Fin.
