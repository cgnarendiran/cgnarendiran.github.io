Hello! I'm Naren, though most people know me as CG (which inspired the logo). I hold a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.uva.nl">University of Amsterdam</a> and a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a>. For my master's thesis, I researched "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Entity Recognition in Text", exploring ways to make text analysis models more adaptable across different domains.

Currently, I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.fastcode.ai/">fastcode.ai</a>, where I develop and implement state-of-the-art machine learning solutions. I collaborate with industry leaders like Mercedes and Aramco to solve complex technical challenges using cutting-edge AI technologies. When I'm not diving into the latest AI developments, you'll find me strumming my ukulele or strategizing my next chess move.
